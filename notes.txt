1.  Problem : when creating a file using agent it gives error:  'touch' is not recognized as an internal or external command.
    Reason: 🤖 On Windows, you can use the command 'echo. > filename.txt' to create a new empty file, where 'filename.txt' is the name of the file you want to create. 
    This is an alternative to the 'touch' command commonly used in Unix-like systems.
    ### This is also figured out by our agent yiepeeeee
    Solution: create a file echo. > notes.txt in my current directory  ....aise use kroo

2. Tools are already provided at "OpenAI assistant API tools" --->"Function calling" .
3. Running the models locally--- to hm ollama lo docker me run karenge for that make .yaml file the ek .py file for routing and all
  -> docker context use default ...run this on terminal 
  -> if docker is not working close it and right click and run as administrator
  ->docker-compose up ...then run this
  ->python ollama_api.py

  //uvicorn ko install kro ->pip install uvicorn
  -> uvicorn ollama_api:app --port 8000
  -> ....link....8000/docs 
  Note: ollama.api.py file me routing compulsory hai then it will work fine

  
4. What is http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs?
   That link opens the automatic API documentation page for your app.
   When you build an app using FastAPI, it automatically creates a web page where you can:
   ✅ See all your API routes
   ✅ Test them directly from the browser
   ✅ Send requests without using Postman
   ✅ See what inputs/outputs are expected
   So /docs = interactive testing page for your backend

5. What is FastAPI? (Simple explanation)
   FastAPI is a tool to build backend servers using Python. 
   FastAPI lets your AI talk to users through the internet
   1️⃣ User sends request
   2️⃣ FastAPI receives it
   3️⃣ FastAPI sends text to AI model
   4️⃣ AI generates answer
   5️⃣ FastAPI sends result back
